Atrisha Sarkar is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Western University](https://uwo.ca), Canada, a Faculty Affiliate at the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/), and Faculty Member at [Rotman Institute of Philosophy](https://www.rotman.uwo.ca/).

She received her Ph.D. from the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo working in [Prof. Krzysztof Czarnecki's](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/profile/k2czarne)lab, and also worked closely with [Prof. Kate Larson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Larson_(computer_scientist)). During this time, she was part of the team behind one of the first self-driving cars on Canadian roads (Autonomoose). Following this, she was a postdoctoral fellow for two years at the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society at the University of Toronto under [Prof. Gillian Hadfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Hadfield), and a research associate with the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Prior to starting grad school, she spent eight years working in industry, primarily at IBM software labs.

Her research spans multiagent systems, behavioral game theory, and computational methods for ensuring the safety of human-centric AI systems at both individual and societal levels. Her interdisciplinary work has addressed challenges in autonomous vehicle safety, online polarization, and human-AI interaction. Atrishaâ€™s research is published across top journals and conferences spanning AI, robotics, and software engineering (AAAI, AAMAS, ASE, ESE, IROS, ICRA, SoSym).
